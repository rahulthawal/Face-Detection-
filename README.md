# Face-Detection-

Task is to implement a discriminative binary classifier for detecting skin regions in images. Implement the skin classifier and produce a set of experimental results to demonstrate the strengths and drawbacks of your classifier. 

A generative version of a classifier is given in the following tutorial, which you can use as a starter code for your implementation:

The code for the above tutorial can be downloaded from the following link:

The discriminative classifier is described in Section 6.4.1 and Section 9.1 of Prince's book (Computer vision:models, learning and inference :Simon J.D. Prince).

A booklet of algorithms from Prince's book has most methods described in the book. For example, Algorithm 9.1 describes the MAP logistic regression.
