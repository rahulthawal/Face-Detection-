Your task is to implement a discriminative binary classifier for detecting skin regions in images. For the assignment, you are expected to implement the skin classifier and produce a set of experimental results to demonstrate the strengths and drawbacks of your classifier. The deadline for completion of this task is Tuesday September 29.  A generative version of a classifier is given in the following tutorial, which you can use as a starter code for your implementation:  http://cs.fit.edu/~eribeiro/teaching/tutorials/tutorial_classifiers/html/main.html (Links to an external site.)   The code for the above tutorial can be downloaded from the following link:  http://cs.fit.edu/~eribeiro/teaching/tutorials/tutorial_classifiers/code.zip (Links to an external site.)   The discriminative classifier is described in Section 6.4.1 and Section 9.1 of Prince's book. You will need to implement a basic {\em logistic-regression classifier}.
